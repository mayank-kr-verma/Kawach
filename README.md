Kawach is an application aimed to minimise crime against women by sending an alarming message with geolocation of victim to their trusted contacts.
Also it can be used to report any crime you happen to come across to nearest police station.

It is a prototype only and hence not all the features work as of now.

The home page of the app changes according to your location. It uses gps to determine your location and then checks crime rate of your city in data provided by government and accordingly places you in one of the three zones namely, Low Risk Zone (App shows green layout), Mid Risk Zone (App shows yellow layout), and High Risk Zone (App shows red layout).
This way you can know which area is safe and which is not and hence stay alert.

If you feel threatened, just press the bell button in the middle of the homepage and a message with your geolocation will be sent to previously registered contacts.
